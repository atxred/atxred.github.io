        <p>The long, long, loooooooong awaited day has finally arrived. I didn't think we'd ever get here. I still am not sure I believe it's happened. I keep expecting to wake up an for it to have all been a dream. We were <em>supposed</em> to have gone into the operating theater at noon, but another of the mothers had complications and had to have an emergency C-Section. So, we got bumped.<br><br>It's not like it's a big deal, we've waited four years for this day to come, and had even given up on it. What's another hour to us.<br><br>So, Robert Nicholas Jenkins-Vasile, or <em><strong>Nick</strong></em> as we plan to call him, is here. God, he's a beautiful and super healthy 8 lbs. 8 oz., 21.5" long little boy. Seriously, this is a beautiful little boy. he's so handsome. He's got dark hair that mostly rings around the sides of his head, with a small dusting on the top. He's got these full lips that are just so cute; no clue where those came from as Mary and I both have thin lips. His eyes are so expressive, how can someone so new have so many different expressions? It's like he's been practicing for months, just so he can entertain me with a slight eyebrow raise that screams suspicion. We've started naming the faces and moves he makes, there's:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#handsome">Handsome Nick</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ninja">Ninja Nick</a></li>
            <li><a href="#not-sleeping">I'm not sleeping, you're sleeping Nick</a></li>
            <li><a href="#hungry">Hungry Nick</a></li>
            <li><a href="#angry">Angry Nick</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p id="handsome"><strong>Handsome Nick</strong> is either suspicious or confused. He can be identified by his narrowed darting eyes. He makes frequent appearances.</p>
        <p id="ninja"><strong>Ninja Nick</strong> is always trying to ward of interlopers. He can be identified by the constant movement of his arms and feet in whirling motions infront of his face. Unfortunately, Nick is a frequent victim of Ninja Nick's actions, self inflicted blows to the head are common.</p>
        <p id="not-sleeping"><strong>I'm not sleeping, you're sleeping Nick</strong> is pretending that he's awake, when he's really trying to be a asleep. He can be identified by the very high raised eyebrows, and the very firmly shut eyelids. This Nick is frequently found after the 2nd burping period of early evening feedings. He is the enemy of Hungry Nick.</p>
        <p id="hungry"><strong>Hungry Nick</strong> is ready to eat. He can be identified by the constant tounge sticking out, and the voracious attemps to gum everything in sight, including his own hands. If this Nick isn't satiated, he's muscle, <a href="#angry"><strong>Angry Nick</strong></a>takes over, and woe be they who call forth <strong>Angry Nick</strong>.</p>
        <p id="angry"><strong>Angry Nick</strong>. Dear God. With the exception of ignoring <a href="#hungry"><strong>Hungry Nick</strong></a>, there's no telling when <strong>Angry Nick</strong> will appear. You don't need a description. You'll know when <strong>Angry Nick</strong> is here. He'll Shriek. He'll Howl. He'll Growl. And he'll do it all until his face is so red, you'll be genuinely concerned. Pray you don't anger Nick.</p>

        <p>Nick got his first bath today, and I gotta be honest, I fully expected him to enjoy it as much as he did. With his big ol' feet, I figure this kid is gonna be good at swimming, he's got all the makings. He's long, and he's lean, and he's got them big paddle feet.</p>
